Lummi Library 2522 Kwina Rd. Bellingham, WA 98226 --- Page 3 --- Dedication This book is dedicated to Mr. Al Charles. In the most important ways Mr. Charles is the author of this book. The book is an outgrowth of the course on Lummi that Mr. Charles taught in the Lummi community, and the facts presented are part of what we learned in the hun- dreds of hours that we have spent with Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles is an ideal teacher. He is patient, thor- ough, and has an obvious love for his language and his people. We hope that the readers of this book will come to appreciate the beauty, subtlety, and the expressive power of the language that Mr. Charles has taught us. Elizabeth Bowman Richard Demers --- Page 4 --- ii Foreword These materials are intended for use by people wishing to learn some basic grammatical features of the Lummi language. Lummi is a complex language with the ability to express anything that can be expressed in any other language. One of the stories that one hears about the Lummi language is that Lummi only has a few hundred (or even a couple of thousand) words. This is false! Lummi has tens of thousands of words, and combined with the Lummi speaker's ability to create new words based on already existing Lummi words, the Lummi vocabulary is enormous. Another statement that one hears about Lummi is that it is a concrete language, and is therefore more suited for expressing simple day-to-day items than abstract ideas. Again, this is false! The most subtle and ab- stract ideas are perfectly capable of being expressed in Lummi. It is true that Lummi does not have readily avail- able a vocabulary to express the items common to our tech- nical world. But neither did English, originally. Just as words were added to English to handle items such as television, or automobile, Lummi is capable of doing the same. [It would be an interesting exercise, in fact, to see how an English speaker who is not familiar with fishing would describe all the part of a complicated Lummi reef net. To a Lummi speaker, the English des- criptions might seem primitive and simple. --- Page 5 --- iii The following introductory text and description of the Lummi language is written at a moderately advanced level, although it can be used as a basis for creating more basic teaching materials on the Lummi language. The individual teacher may want to emphasize certain points and add additional material. There is, however, a blunt fact which must be faced from the beginning: The Lummi language for someone who knows only English is extremely difficult. The sounds are quite different from the sounds of English, and Lummi grammar is also very complicated to an English speaker. Lummi grammar has its own logic, but it differs in radical ways from English. This will be- come clear as one reads and works through the chapters of this book. Lummi is a member of the Salish language family, the largest group of languages in the Northwest. The Salish family extends geographically from the Bella Coolas in British Columbia to the Tillamooks in Oregon. Salish Languages are also found in Alberta, Canada and also in Idaho and Montana in the United States. The languages located east of the Cascade Mountains are referred to as Interior Salish languages, and those west of the Cascades are labelled Coast Salish. Most of the Native American languages in northern and western Washington belong to the Salish family. --- Page 6 --- iv Lummi can be subclassified as a dialect of Straits Coast Salish, a family which includes Clallam, Samish, Songish, Saanich, Sooke and Semiahmoo. Persons speaking the Straits languages can all easily talk to each other. The attempt has been made to use a non-technical vocabulary in describing the properties of Lummi grammar. However, Lummi is so complex that an honest description must reveal some of this complexity. An attempt will be made therefore to describe Lummi in straightforward terms. The alphabet used in this description will be foreign to most readers. At the time of the writing of this intro- duction, the Lummi Tribal Council had not yet decided on what alphabet to use. The alphabet used in this descrip- tion is based on the alphabet developed by Terry and Larry Thompson. What ever alphabet is ultimately chosen, the one used in this description can be easily converted. Once the alphabet used in this description is mastered, the Lummi vocabulary in any article written about Lummi in the most recent linguistic journals can be read. --- Page 7 --- Dedicati Foreward CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CONTENTS CrloonoousDooodooo Do oUD OD oOU OOD ODd oO D Od Gb boob OdG i Pee eee ee ee ee ee eee eee eee ee ee tenet eee li 1 - The Sounds of Lummi............ 0... eee ee eee 1 2 - Simple Lummi Sentences.........-....0000eee 11 3 - QUueStiONS...... cece cece eee eee ence tees 15 4 ~ Adjectives... ... cece cece eee tee eee eens 19 5 - Predicate Tenses... .. cece cece eee eee eens 23 6 - Verbal Objects... cece cece eee eee 27 7 ~ Dependent Clauses... . cee ee cece e reece enee 31 8 - Negative Sentences... .. cece cece ee een ee eaee 35 9 - The Passive Voice... .. ccc cee eee eee eee eens 40 10 - Interrogative Pronouns and nii-sentences..45 11 - How The Lummi People Came To Their Present Location And How They Got Their Name...Lummi Version.............02200 eee $1 69 Loy steko Wirt ogo ooOoOOUDDOODdUdd0U0D0000 --- Page 8 --- Chapter 1 The Sounds of Lummi 0. The sounds of Lummi are very similar to those sounds found in other Native American languages in the Northwest. Linguists have noted that languages which are unrelated may nevertheless share many features of sounds and grammar if they are located in the same geographical area. In Europe, for example, the Finnish and Hungarian languages bear no known relationship to English, German, or French, although the sound systems of these languages are relatively similar. Likewise, many of the sounds of Lummi, a member of the Sa- lishan language family, are similar to those sounds of the Quileute (a Chimakuan language) or the Makah (a Wakashan language). The Lummi, Quileute, and Makah languages have never been shown to be genetically related. Although many of the sounds of the languages of the Native American languages of the Northwest are similar to each other, many of these sounds (especially the consonants) are very different from the sounds of the European languages. Thus, for someone who speaks English and who wishes to speak Lummi words correctly, a lot of practice will be necessary. The sounds of Lummi are discussed below, and the best way to learn them is to practice them in the presence of a Lummi speaker. However, good approximations can be made from tapes and if you do not have easy access to someone who speaks Lummi, we recommend that you listen to some Lummi --- Page 9 --- which has been recorded. There are two major types of sounds in the Lummi lan- guage, vowels and consonants. In general terms, the dif- ferent vowels are made by the different shape of the open vocal tract when air is passing through. The consonant sounds are those produced by either a narrowing, constric- tion, or closure at one or more of the points along the vocal tract. The vocal tract is the region extending from the voice box (Adam's apple) to the lips. ls Vowel Sounds. The vowel sounds are relatively easy, and we begin with examples using familiar consonants that are found in English. 1.1. The i-sound. This letter represents a sound that varies between an 'ee' sound as in English 'beet' and the sound in English 'say', although the vowel is more pure and steady than it is in English. Listen to your teacher pro- nmounce these words. Examples: ni ‘there is, there are' his ‘a long time ago' 1.2. The e-sound. This letter is usually pronounced like the vowel sound in English 'man', although it may be pro- nounced 'higher' like the vowel sound in 'get'. The Lummi word for 'father', which sounds like the English word 'man' is written men. --- Page 10 --- Examples: men 'father' ten ‘'mother' 1.3. The e-sound. This letter (called schwa by linguists) represents the emphasized vowel in English 'sun', and also the sound in the unemphasized first vowel of ‘about’. Examples: tomes ‘fur, velvet! séles ‘hand! Note: The vowel that has the main emphasis will be noted with an accent mark. For example, in English, a convict is a man who goes to prison after he has been con- victed of breaking a law. 1.4. The o-sound. The o is similar to the sound of the vowels in the English words 'bought' or ‘caught’. Examples: soOsan 'mouth' nos ‘fat! 1.5. The u-sound. This letter represents a sound which varies between the vowel of English 'boot', and the lower sound of 'boat'. It is usually pronounced in its lower variety, although the example words are usually pronounced in their higher variety. Examples: tuwo ‘early' i ' ' musmus cow Bo The consonants. Many of the consonants of Lummi are very different from those of English, and they will require --- Page 11 --- more work than the vowels for an English speaker who is trying to speak Lummi. Some of the sounds are very much like those found in English, and we begin our discussion with these. 2.1. The p-sound. The p- sound is like that of English. It is strongly aspirated (a strong puff of air is expelled when the p is released). Examples: laplét ‘priest' (borrowing from French) snep ""advice! 2.2. The t-sound., The t-sound is like that of English. Like the p-sound, it is strongly aspirated. Examples: timast ‘to do something vigorously’ titisan ‘up the river’ 2.3. The s-sound. Pronounce the s-sound like English s. Examples: sne ‘name! swem ‘horse clam' 2.4. The m, n, 1 and h sounds are either the same or very similar to their equivalent sounds in English. Words with these sounds have already been given in the earlier examples. 2.5. Sounds which occur in English but which use different symbols. 2.5.1. The n. This symbol represents a sound which is found in English but is not represented in the English alphabet. An m is like a b with the nasal passages open, and an n is like ad with the nasal passages open, and an n (called engwa) is --- Page 12 --- like a g with the nasal passages open. This sound is usually written as ng in English. When one says the English word ""sing', the ng is actually just the single sound n. It is not n plus g. The normal n-sound is made with the tip of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth. The n-sound is made with the back of the tongue touching further back along the roof of the mouth. In English the n-sound only appears at the end or in the middle of words. In Lummi n can appear not only at the end or the middle of the words, it can also appear at the beginning of words. Examples: son 'to go up (into the woods)' ténan ‘evening, dusk {before it is dark)' nane? ‘child’ 2.5.2. The S-sound. This letter stands for the sound usually written as sh in English. Examples: stomeS 'warrior' Semat ‘land that appears at low tide' 2.5.3. The €-sound. This symbol represents the sound usually represented by ch in English. Examples: Sané ""harvest, catch' €3nes ""tooth! 2.5.4. The ?-sound. The symbol that looks like a poeecion mark without the dot at the bottom is a symbol for a glottal stop. It is very common in Lummi. This sound is made by stopping the flow of air from your lungs in your throat. Try --- Page 13 --- exhaling and stopping the air without closing your mouth. When you've done this you've used your vocal cords (the elastic bands in your voice box) to stop the air. Every word in Lummi that sounds as if it begins with a vowel actually begins with a glottal stop (the same is true of English). Examples: ?ané? ""come! si?em 'sir' (Lummi term of respect, related to the word Sehome) s?emeS 'Samish' To say this last word, make the s-sound, stop the flow of air with your vocal cords (make the glottal stop) and then continue into the 2emas part. Listen to your teacher do this a few times and you'll be able to do it. 2.6. Sounds not found in English. 2.6.1. The q-sound. The q-sound is similar to the k sound of English (Lummi has very few words with k), but the sound is made with the tongue touching further back along the roof of the mouth than the k in English 'car'. Examples: qalas 'dull' qen 'steal' géngen ‘thief! 2.6.2. The x-sound. The x-sound is similar to the q-sound, with the main difference being that the flow of air is not stopped. There is a distinct scraping sound as the tongue constricts the flow of air past this point along the roof of the mouth. --- Page 14 --- Examples: sxana ""Leg' 2ex-n 'to say' 2.6.3. The c-sound. This sound is similar to a ts sequence of sounds, although it is actually a single sound. It is like the é-sound, only instead of being made with the area just in back of the tip of the tongue, the c-sound is made with the tip of the tongue. This sound is found in only a few Lummi words, although it occurs in one of the most common words: ca 'the, a! 2.6.4. The J-sound. The J-sound, also called a voiceless 1, is called a lateral fricative by linguists. It carries the label lateral because when the tongue tip is touching just behind the teeth, the air passes on both sides of the tongue. It is called a fricative because the tongue is con- stricted against the roof of the mouth so that noise (friction) is created. It is a very common sound in Lummi. To make this sound, make an ] and then as the air is flowing, stop your vocal cords from vibrating (you can do this, don't worry) and raise the tongue closer to the roof of the mouth so that noise is created. With a little practice, this sound is re- latively easy to make. Examples: sJéni? ‘wife, woman' s1amax“ 'rain' 2.6.5. The sounds k”, q™”, x“, and x”. --- Page 15 --- The sounds that these symbols represent are also very much like sounds already discussed. The raised w indicates that they are all accompanied by lip rounding. This feature of rounding of the lips is also called labialization by lin- guists. The k” sound is like the English quin quick. The x” sound is a velar fricative, which means that air passing between the back of the tongue and the roof of the mouth is constricted and makes a scraping, whistling sound. It is similar to the sound one would make if one were imitating the blowing of the winter wind. The qY sound is very similar to the k” sound with the main difference being that the con- tact point of the tongue is even further back along the roof of the mouth. This sound therefore has a somewhat 'deeper' sound than the k*. Examples: k* k“agil ‘early in the morning' k“Snet 'Take it!' x” x“i?lom ‘rope, thread! x“itan ‘jump! qY qveni 'seagull' qve?on ‘mosquito! x"" x“on ‘to cry' x“3tq’am ‘noisy, rushing water' (Lummi name for Bellingham (Whatcom) .) 2.6.6. The glottalized sounds of Lummi: p, t’, ¢, @, kY, 4, a“, (4). One of the most distinctive sets of sounds in Lummi --- Page 16 --- is the glottalized series. The term glottalization refers to the manner of articulation. In discussing the glottal stops earlier, we mentioned that fact that the vocal cords can be closed, stopping the air flow. The air stream from the lungs can also be stopped in the upper part of the vocal tract at the same time. Thus there can be two points of closure at the same time. A stop made in the upper part of the vocal tract (for example, all of the sounds listed at the beginning of this section) can be glottalized if the voice box (with closed vocal cords) is raised just before the stop is released. When the voice box is raised, the air pressure inside the vocal tract increases because the cavity is made smaller. When the upper stop is released, it does so under more pres- sure than is the case for the unglottalized stops, and a dis- tinctive popping sound can be heard. Actually, the glottali- zation feature may be quite subtle, and much practice is re- quired before this feature can always be identified. Examples: p- sound pawi 'flounder' po?n ‘to swell up' t’-sound t’élaw ‘arm! st’élenex” ‘medicine' é-sound ¢isten ‘antler’ Liget ""to cut it! é-sound @3neé ‘crowded, jammed' 23mas ‘dried herring eggs' --- Page 17 --- 10 q-sound gé?ni 'teen-aged girl' dep ""to gather' q“-sound q“Slan ‘ear' qual ‘cooked, ripe’ 2.6.7. The i-sound. The 'glottalized lateral affricate' is one of the most important Lummi sounds. Many Native American languages of the Northwest have this sound. It is made by suddenly releasing the air along the sides of the tongue. Begin by making an 1, and then stop the air from flowing by raising the tongue so that the air flow is blocked. Next, keeping the tongue tip temporarily on the roof of the mouth, release the air on both sides of the tongue making a 'popping sound'. Do not drop the sides of your tongue too far, since the effect you are striving for is the sound of the air passing along the sides of the tongue. The glottalization feature enhances the popping aspect of the sounds and helps contribute to its unique character. This sound will take lots of practice. . Observe some Lummi speakers and try to imitate them. Examples: hi? 'like, love' Aax“lex” ‘oyster’ --- Page 18 --- 1i Chapter 2 Simple Lummi Sentences is In Lummi sentences the verb very often comes first. 1) x€it-sen ce swdy?qa? 'I know the man.! know-I the man 2) x€it-sx” sea széni? ‘You know the woman.! know-you the woman 3) -x€it-s ca swirqd?al ca sway?qa? 'The boy knows the man.'! 4) x€it-2 sa slen®6?az ‘We know the girl.! NOTE 1): The word meaning 'I' in sentence (1) is -san. It is attached to the verb xtit 'know' and forms a single unit of pronunciation. When 'you' is the subject add -sx“ to the verb. When 'we' is the subject add -Z, and whenever the sub- ject is third person (he, she, it, or they) add -s to the verb. NOTE 2): The definite (or indefinite) article is usually ce in Lummi, although Se- will occur chiefly with feminine nouns (sa sléni? 'the woman'), NOTE 3): The forms swi?qo?et and sZen&6?al are diminutive forms of the nouns sway?qe? and sléni?, respectively. The term diminutive simply means 'a smaller version of'. Thus a boy is seen to be a smaller version of a man. The term sienéo?ei means 'little girl', whereas gé?ni? is a teen-aged girl. Ze Here are some additional simple Lummi sentences. --- Page 19 --- 12 5) len-i-t-sen ca sway?qa? ‘I'm looking at the man.' 6) len-i-t-sx” ca ?élan ""You are looking at the house.' 7) 1én-nax“-san se sléni? 'I see (caught a glimpse of) the woman.' 8) lén-nex“-2% ce sténex"" ""We see (caught a glimpse of) the salmon.’ NOTES: 'To look at' and 'to see' are both based on the same verb root len- ‘see'. When -nex“ follows the verb, the idea of the verb is that the action is not under the control of the subject of the sentence. The addition of a t oor -i-t in- dicates that the subject has some degree of control over the action. The term 'control' has, in fact, been given to the item 't' by the linguists Terry and Larry Thompson. Lummi is very logical in these constructions. When you look at ‘something you consciously and willfully maintain your vision on it (len-i-t). When you catch a glimpse of something, or happen to see it, you do not do it willfully. If your eyes are open, you will see it (len-nex”). Some additional sen- tences utilizing -nex” and -t- will further demonstrate their use in Lummi. 9) é3s-nex“-sen ""I hit it (accidentally).' 10) és$-t-son 'I hit it (on purpose).' 11) xi2-noxY-san ‘I scratched it (accidentally).' 12) xit-t-sen 'I scratched it (on purpose).' --- Page 20 --- 15: NOTES: 1) Sometimes the word éas 'hit' will be pronounced ésa. For the time being learn to use ¢as with nex” and tsa with -t. 2) We will translate some of the Lummi sentences into present or past time (tense) in English. Tense is not as important in Lummi as in English. 3.

The mother hit the child (accidentally). e. You are watching (looking at) the child. f. We know the father and the mother (use ?i? for the word ‘and'). --- Page 22 --- 15 Chapter 3 Questions. i. How to ask a question in Lummi, a) xtit-a-sx” ca swdy?qa? ""Do you know the man?’ b) xéit-e-sen se széni? ‘Do I know the woman?! c) ?ilen-a-2% (2) ca séénex” ‘Do we eat salmon?! Questions that require a yes or no answer in Lummi can be made by inserting an -a- element after the verb (and other sentence initial items as we will learn later), but before some of the subject pronouns. The third person pronoun, however, requires that the question particle appear to the right of a subject pronoun. d) 1én-na-s-o ce swoy?qa? ""Did he/they get a glimpse of the man?' For the present, then, if the subject is first or second person (-sen, 1S als -1), the question particle will appear between the verb and the subject pronouns. If the subject is third person, the question particle will appear after the s. Ze Possessive Pronouns. a) na-mén ""my father’ b) = 2an-tén ‘your mother! c) nene-s ""his child! d) sq’emay?-1 ‘our dog' --- Page 23 --- 16 The possessive pronouns are attached to the noun they modify. We have been using a hyphen to indicate this attach- ment. The first person singular pronoun ne- and the second person pronoun *en- are attached to the front of (prefixed to) their noun. The first person pronoun -J, and the third person pronoun -s are attached to the end of (suffixed to) their noun. or Refinements of simple Lummi sentences. a) ?u? xéit-sen co sway?qa? ‘I know the man.' “so sJeni? b) ?u? 1én-nax""-sx ""You caught a glimpse of the woman.' c) 74? leni-t-son ca swi?qd?al ""I am looking at the boy.' The initial elements, ?u?, and ?i? are aspect markers in Lummi, and they are extremely difficult to assign English meanings to. The particle ?i?,which is identical in form to the Lummiword for'and',may in fact be the same word. When used with sentences it may be indicating that the sentence is related 'simultaneously' to some other event. The Fi? may require that the following sentences be connected with some other event (either stated or unstated). For example, in the sentence ?i? len-i-t-sen k” s5-i-Sot-n-s 'I am looking at the man as he is walking by' the initial ?i? could well be indicating that the 'man walking by' is --- Page 24 --- 17 connected with 'my seeing him'. The ?i? also appears to strengthen the force of a statement. The expression ?i? Sat-n means 'he's (really) walking (and not crawling)’. The Sat-n by itself simply means ‘he's walking’. The ?u? particle is much more difficult to understand although it appears very frequently in Lummi sentences. It also appears to have a linking function like ?i?. It may be used to indicate that there is a causal or temporal re- lation between two events. ?u? xéit-soen meaning 'I know it' may be implying 'I know it (for some reason)’. The actual meaning of this particle is an excellent topic for future investigation. Additional Vocabulary a) sténox ‘salmon (or fish in general)' b) Pinas ‘grandchild’ c) sile ‘grandparent’ d) 2o?maq ‘great grandparent, great grandchild’ e) elan ‘house! £) séerEa ‘friend, relative’ g) k“anat 'to take something’ h) = séles ""hand! i) sxéno ‘leg, foot' 3) t’elaw? ‘arm! The word 26?maq” is used for both great grandparent and great grandchild. it is common in languages to have terms meaning ‘two generations, or three generations distant'. Note that --- Page 25 --- 18 English uses the word grand- which expresses the relation ‘two generations apart (and directly related)’. 4.

'The woman is good.' good the woman e) sxes ceo ne-Semen ""My enemy is bad.’ bad the my enemy Lummi adjectives frequently occur at the beginning of sentences. In this way (and other ways to be discussed below) they are acting like verbs. This order of words may appear odd to a speaker of English, but it must be re- membered that this strangeness only results because of the difference from English. After you learn more Lummi, the sentences given above will begin to seem very natural to you. These sentences also reflect the fact that Lummi, like many of the world's languages, does not use a verb meaning ‘to be'. The Lummi word for wife (sno¢e?) is related to the counting system. The word for 'one' is neca?, and one (or another) person is noce?. Thus a wife is viewed as ""the other one"". --- Page 27 --- 20 Counting in Lummi naca? ""one! é3sa ""two! Liwx™ ‘three! jos 'four' ? Lqets ‘five’ t?xan ""six! ? co?k™s ""seven' te?ss ‘eight’ takYx"" ave 26 ' t open ten The Lummi numbers may seem complicated at first, but that is only because they use a lot of the sounds not found in English. With a little practice they will seem easier. Zz. More on the use of pronouns. We have already discussed the use of the pronouns son, sx"", zi and -s in the second chapter. There is a refinement in the use of the 3rd person pronoun which can be discussed now. a) len-i-t-sen ca sway?qa? ‘I see the man.' b) len-i-t-sx"" co swoy?qa? ‘You see the man.' c) xtit-J ca swey?qe? ‘We know the man.' d) k“Snat-s ""He is taking it.' e) len-i-t-s ca sway?qes? 'He is looking at the man.' --- Page 28 --- 21 Sentence (e) has the English translation 'He (or she or it) is looking at the man'. We stated earlier that the -s element was used whenever the subject was 3rd per- son. An example from the second chapter was xtit-s ca swi?qo?el so sway?qa? 'The boy knows the man’. or Consider now the following sentences. £) ye?-san 'T go.! g) ye?-sx"" ""You go.' h) ye?-2 'We go.! i) ye? ""He/She/It goes.! j) ye? ca sway?qa? 'The man is going.' In sentences (i) and (j) although the subject is third person, no -s marking that the subject is third person occurs. In fact, it is not allowed to appear. A sentence such as *ye?-s ca sway?qa? sounds bad to a Lummi speaker much as *he go sounds bad to a speaker of standard English. The difference between the sentences (a-e) as opposed to (f-j) is that the verbs in the first group (a-e) are transitive and the verbs in the second group (f-j) are intransitive. A transitive verb is one which can have an object. In the case of 'see', one can see something. In the case of 'go', one cannot 'go' anything, and thus it is not possible to transfer the action of 'go' onto another object. (It is therefore 'Intransitive'’.) Just remember, if the verb cannot take an object, then the --- Page 29 --- 22 third person element s does not appear. For the most part, you can use your knowledge of English to help you here. The verb meaning 'to come' is ?ané?. The verb is intran- sitive, so to translate ""The man is coming"", you would write ?ene? ca sway?qea?. 4.

'The man was good.' d) ?ay?-so-san ""I will be good.' e) ?ene?-lse ca sway?qa? ‘The man came.' The past tense is indicated by the presence of the suffix -la. It is attached onto the end of the verb, and appears before any subject pronouns. Many languages do not have a past tense marker (Chinese being an example). Lummi frequently will leave it out. Whether the sentence refers to the present or past will be determined by context. That is, if the speaker is talking about something that obviously happened in the past, the past tense marker is not necessary. The future tense with sa corresponds to English sentence which have the helping verb ‘will’. The suffix -la also has another interesting use. When placed on a proper noun it indicates that the person is deceased, The phrase ne-men-la means 'my late father’. os The numbers 11-20 11 is ?opanicanete? --- Page 31 --- 24 12 is ?openiceéesa 13 is ?opanicayiwx” 14 is ?opeanicanos 15 is ?openicelgets 16 is ?openicat’xan 17 is ?opaniceto?k""s 18 is ?opaniceate?ss 19 is ?opanicatak""x™ 20 is cax""k%Ss The numbers 11-19 are transparent once one knows the numbers 1-10. The number '1l1' is rendered in Lummi by ‘ten! and 'one'. The -ics- sequence is a combination of ‘and’ ?i? and 'the' ca. Lummi forms its numerals in a manner sim- ilar to the Spanish numerals 16-19. ‘'Sixteen' in Spanish is dies y seis which translated literally means ten (dies) and (y) six (seis). The word for twenty (¢ex""k""8s) appears to bear little relation to the word for two (sa). Te The nominalizing prefix s-. Predicate Noun a) ?iten 'to eat' b) s-?izen 'food' c) nop-t 'to advise' d) s-ne ""advice! e) xed 'be sick' £) s-xel ‘sickness’ Many predicates can be turned into nouns by an s- prefix. The s- prefix corresponds in many ways to the English suffix -ing. A verb such as ‘eat' can be turned into a noun by the addition of an -ing to form ‘eating' as in 'the eating of the salmon'. --- Page 32 --- 25 There is an important verb in Lummi which has the Be prefix. g) na-s-+i? ca sway?qa? my-liking the man 'I like the man.' h) s-%i?-s sa sLéni? liking-his the woman ""He likes the woman.’ This predicate s-xi? which means 'to like, love or want! has the form of a noun. When used as predicate, however, the s- prefix must be present, and requires that subject pronouns be realized as possessive pronouns. Thus to say ""I like' you have to use a form which appears to be 'my liking' (na-shi?). However, for a Lummi speaker the form na-sti? is natural and is best rendered as 'I like! (or ‘I want', or 'I love', etc.).

The above sentences exhibit several new features of Lummi. In sentence a), the n following the root len- is a short- ened form of nax“. The nex” appears as n when ever it appears before certain suffixes, such as -onas. The form -ones itself can mean either 'you or me'. When the subject pronoun is sx"" 'you', -onas means 'me'. When the subject pronoun is -san 'I' the -onas translates as 'you'. For the meaning 'you see you', or ‘you see yourself', Lummi uses a different form of the ojbect pronoun called the reflexive. We will discuss this construction in a later chapter. In sentence c) we observe that third person object pronouns are not expressed. Thus when a Lummi speaker says 'I see it' the 'it' does not appear in the Lummi sentence. It is understood. Sentence c) can mean then, ‘I caught a glimpse of him', or 'I caught a glimpse of something'. Sentences d) and e) exhibit a couple of complications. In Chapter 2, the verb len-i-t ‘to look at' was introduced. --- Page 35 --- 28 If we followed the rules used to form sentence a), we would expect *len-i-t-onas-sen to appear. However, whenever -i- and -ones appear together, the -onas is short- ened to -s-. Also, the t and the i switch positions. 0 Adverbs. a) yos-sen ?u? nep-t ca swey?qge? ‘I always advise the man.' b) yos-a-sx” ?u? nap-t ca sway?qa? ""Are you always advising the man?! c) yos-Z ?u? nep-t ca swi?go?al ‘We are always advising the boy.' dj) yos-le ?u? nap-t sa sfeni? ""He always advised the woman.’ Adverbs in Lummi sentences are usually in sentence initial position. Items in the first position in the sen- tence will have the question marker, the subject pronouns and tense markers (-la and -sea) attached. We have already seen in Chapter 4, that adjectives which occur in sentence initial position will have subject pronouns and tense markers. It is a general feature of Lummi, then, that when elements such as verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or nouns are in sentence initial position any tense markers, or subject pronouns will be attached to this initial item. There is one important exception to this. The third person pronoun only appears on transitive verbs. Thus, it will not appear on nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. In sentence d) above, --- Page 36 --- 29 then, the third person is understood if no other subject pronoun is present. os Additional Vocabulary. a) del ""also, too' Adverb, patterns like yos-. b) si?itu ‘really, extremely' Adverb c) tu ‘still’ Adverb (e.g. tu ?omne-? ‘They're still playing.') d) naqix ""black! e) paq ‘white! f) nesaq™ ‘red! g) naq’3y ‘yellow! h) nahdz 'green' i) %iye?oles ""blue! 4.

'I know that the man came.' d) xéit sa sféni? k” ne-s-?ané? 'The woman knows that I am coming.' The sentences in (1) exhibit the most common type of subordinate structure in Lummi--the k“-clause. The kY- clause is very similar to the type of construction in Eng- lish in which that precedes a sentence, For example, in sentence (la) the sequence that you caught a glimpse of the man is a subordinate clause, and the that is a subordinator (or subordinating conjunction). Another feature of the Lummi subordinate clause is that normal subject pronouns such as -san, sx“, etc., appear as possessive pronouns. The predicate also has an s- prefixed on it. Thus what would appear as len-nex”-sean in a regular (non-subordinate sentence) becomes na-s-len-nax”, when subordinated. This type of construction may appear foreign to you at first, but English has a very similar construction. In the sen- tence My liking Mary surprised Bill, the sequence My liking --- Page 40 --- 33 Mary is the subordinate for I like Mary. The verb like has -ing added to it (making it noun-like) and the sub- ject is put into the possessive form, 'I' becomes 'my'. Thus Lummi shares some important structural features with English in regard to sentence subordination. re Numbers. éax“kYasicansca?

Baker'. The most common type of negative sentence in Lummi is introduced with the element *aw?. Sentence (1b) is a shortened version of sentence (la). In other words, negative sentences in Lummi usually contain subordinate clauses. A rough English translation of (la) would be: ""It is not the case for me that (my) seeing Mt. Baker occurs"". There is a subtle difference in meaning between (la) and (1c). Sentence (la) emphasizes that 'I' can't see the mountain. There may be a tree in the way, or I'm not in the right position. Sentence (lc) suggests that it is generally not the case that 'I' can't see the moun- tain. Maybe it is cloudy. Thus in sentence (ic) there is less emphasis on the role of the first person subject. Lummi has a lot of subtle things like this, and learning these points takes a lot of work. There is another point which causes some confusion to beginning students of Lummi. Note the following pair of sentences. d) ?ew? sxéit-s sa seni? 'The woman doesn't know it.' e) ?aw? s-xéit so seni? S-xc1t sea sfeni’ ""Someone doesn't know the woman.' f) aw? s-x€it-s co sway?qa? sa sleni? In these negative sentences with 3rd person subjects, --- Page 44 --- 37 if there is an s on the predicate, then the following noun is the subject. If there is no s, then the following noun is object. If there is an s, and two nouns follow, the noun immediately following the predicate is usually the subject. Lummi does allow some freedom of word order if the context is clear. Thus, sentence might also mean 'The woman doesn't know the man'. The word k“elSén is interesting. Many people in Bellingham (including the United States Forest Service) think that kYal3én means ‘great, white watcher’. The word is made up of two parts k“3la$ and -en. k“alas means to shoot or strike a sharp blow, and -en means ‘a place'. Thus, the combination k”alSén means ‘the place where a blow was struck. The name originated after Mt. Baker erupted in the middle of the 19th century. After a particularly severe thunderstorm, Mt. Baker was smoking, thus it appeared that lighting had struck the mountain, causing it to erupt. Zs Another negative construction. a) ?3wene ?an-smaéqon ""You're crazy!' (You don'to have a brain.) b) Swans spto? 'There aren't any baskets.' --- Page 45 --- 38 c) ?3awene no-stenax” 'I don't have any fish.' The expression ?4wana means ‘There isn't or aren't any .. .'. Thus, a sentence such as (lc) would roughly translate as ""There aren't any my fish"", but the best English for it is I don't have any fish'. 3. Plurals. Earlier we stated that Lummi does not normally overtly pluralize its nouns. Thus, ca sway?qa? might mean 'the man' or 'the men'. When it is necessary to show plurality, Lummi nouns can undergo a process called reduplication. Reduplication simply means that the first part of the word is copied and added to the front of the word. Thus a word such as sila becomes silsile?. The first i is reduced (becomes 9) so the plural of grandparent silo? is salsila?. Another way that plurality can be indicated is by insert- ing a -e9l- inside the word after the first consonant. Thus, ¢isten 'antler' becomes ¢alistan. The process of plural formations is quite complicated. Some examples are listed below. Another way to form a plural is to insert an -i- after the first consonant in the word. An example of this is siwsy?qa 'men' from swey?qo? ‘man’. Words fall into various classes depending on which way they form their plural. This situation for plural formation --- Page 46 --- 39 in Lummi is similar to the situation in English in that the word child must be pluralized as children, the word man becomes men, and goat becomes goats. 4.

'The man caught a glimpse of me.' or 'I was spotted by the man.! The sentences in (1) are examples of a grammatical structure which corresponds closely to the English passive construction. The passive in English is a sentence such as 'I was hit by the man'. The term 'passive' is used because the subject will frequently have a 'passive' role in the action being described. The sentence 'The man hit me’ expresses action on the part of the subject, 'the man'. Thus, the sentences 'I was hit by the man' and 'the man hit me' are semantically related in that both are descrip- tions of the same event. In English, every transitive sentence has a passive counter part, and vice-versa. This is not the case in Lummi. For some sentences, Lummi can only have the 'passive form'. Sentence (la) is an example of this type. The hypothetical active counterpart of this sentence should be xtit ca sway?qa? 'The man knows it' be- cause the 3rd person object is never expressed. The sen- tence xéit ca sway?qa? does not mean 'The man knows it’. It means 'know the man!', an imperative sentence where the subject is an understood 'you'. The only way to render ‘The man knows it' in Lummi is with sentence (la), which --- Page 49 --- 42 is like 'It is known by the man'. Another way to say it then, is that when the object is a 3rd person pronoun, Lummi requires the passive-type construction. The passive is formed by adding either t or nax™ (-n-) to the verb stem, followed by the suffix -n. The t and nex“ carry their usual meaning. 2. Prepositions. a) sil-n-le 2 co sol 'He was standing on the road.' b) ®asnowel-le 2 ca Velen ""He was in(side) the side.’ c) ?u? ye? seq” ‘He ran through it.' ad) da&Siawal ‘It's underneath.' e) ?asté?ta 9 co pict ""He's sitting (lying) on the bed.' Lummi does not have prepositions of the type found in English. Many of the ideas conveyed by prepositions in English, are conveyed by full predicates in Lummi. In English one might say 'The rabbit ran through the fence’, in Lummi one has to break this into two parts: ?i? kYen-i-n-t co hopit, ye? ?u? sJaqg*st a qelexen, 'As the rabbit was running, it went through the fence’. The --- Page 50 --- 43 essential idea here is that Lummi prepositions usually act as predicates. The expression newal ‘in(side)' should be treated as a predicate meaning 'to be inside’. The particle a does function occasionally as a uni- versal preposition. We saw it being used to mean 'by' in the passive construction discussed in the previous section. In sentence (2a), it is best translated as 'on'. In sen- tences (2b) it is rendered best by English 'in'. sn More predicates. a) Jamx* ‘It's raining.' b) éamonest-sen 'I'm getting wet.' c) C1?x""-n-sa 'It will be cold.’ (about weather) d) ¢6?1-n-san 'I'm cold.'! e) gen-n ‘I'm shivering.' £) sex“-sx” ""You're lazy.! g) tal-n-dnat-sx"" 'T understand it.' h) tog“-n-sen 'I'm coughing.’ (used for 'I have a cold. i} Ligat ‘Cut it.! j) qeéy?les 'He is sad.' 4.

'Who is he looking at?' £) sten k” an-s-hi2 2 ‘What do you want?! The Lummi word for 'who' is wet and for 'what' is sten. As is the case in English the question word comes first, but unlike English, the Lummi interrogatives have many of the features of predicates. For example, the 'rest' of the sentence that follows occurs is a subordinate clause introduced by the k“ marker. The Lummi sentences with the interrogative markers wet and sten come closest to English sentences such as ""Who is it such that he sees the man?"". This translation would fit sentence (la). The appearance of the 3rd person subject s marker follows the pattern found in subordinate clauses. If there is an -s on the verb, the following noun is the subject (cf. sentence lb). If there is no -s on the verb, the following noun is the object (cf. sentence la). The sentences (lc) and (1d) add a new wrinkle. In- stead of the normal possessive pronoun markers ne- and ?an-, the reduced forms -n (from -san) and x” (from -sx"") --- Page 54 --- 47 are used. These reduced pronouns occur in the suffix position where subject Pronouns are normally found. (30 niZ- sentences. a) nil ca swoy?qe? 'That's the man.'! b} nil-le sa sléni?

In sentence (2d) one of the most frequently idiomatic uses of nil is demonstrated when nij introduces a subordinate clause (e.g. nif k™“ s-Verb...), the sequence nid k* s- is frequently translated into English as 'then'. A rough English translation of (2nd) is 'It was that I went'. This translation begins to get close to the meaning 'Then I went’. ites Relative clauses. a) nid ti?a swey?qa? k¥ len-i-t 'That's the man that sees it.! --- Page 55 --- 48 b) nid ti?e swey?qa? len-i-t-s 'That's the man that he sees.' c) niZ ti?e sway?qa? len-t-i-n ‘That's the man I saw.' d) x€it-sen ca sway?qe? kY¥ len-i-t 'I know the man that saw it. e) x€it-san ca sway?qo? kY len-i-t-s ‘I know the man that he knows.'! f) tu hek¥ ca sway?qa? k* ne-s-len-n-n ‘He still remembers the man that saw me.' g) nid ca sway?qe? xot-n-onas ‘That's the man that knows me.' These sentences will give the reader a taste of the variety of possibilities for expression that are available in Lummi. They will also give the reader an indication of the structural complexity which can be found in Lummi. Sentences (3a-c) demonstrate how predicates next to nouns can be attributive in their function. The predicate len-i-t by itself means '(you) watch it’, but when next to the noun ti?a sway?qa?, it means ‘that sees it’. In this position it is a relative clause. The form that the subject pronouns take in these constructions is the re- duced variety discussed in section 1 of this chapter. Sentence (1d) is an example of another type of rela- tive clause construction. This sentence has a kY (that) --- Page 56 --- 49 present. As was the case with earlier kY sentences, subject pronouns are found in their possessive form. An example of this is sentence (3f). Sentence (3f) is especially interesting because the subordinate sentence has a passive verb len-n-n 'to be seen'. Thus, another English translation could be ‘that's the man I was seen by'. Thus the sequence len-n-n-San becomes ne-s-len-n-n when it occurs in a subordinate clause. Instead of the passive form, it is possible for the first person to appear as an object pronoun. This is demonstrated in (3g). Actually sentence (eg) is ambiguous and could mean ‘that's the man that knows you'. The ambi- quity in ones may be why Lummi speakers prefer structures such as (3f) where the subject pronoun is unambiguous. 4.

Jesse Sawyer, Uni- versity of California Publications, no. 65 (Berkeley: Uni- versity of California Press, 1971) pp. 251-94) and Efrat (Barbara Efrat, ""A Grammar of Non-Particles in Sooke, a Dia- lect of Straits Coast Salish"" (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1969). The phoneme /e/ is usually pronounced {#], /o/ is [5], and /i/ varies between [i] and [e], but is usually the lower variant. Rounded consonants (e.g. q"", k“) and palatal consonants (e.g. y, €) have an effect on vowels, especially in unstressed position. We have ignored these effects in the phonemic transcription. For a discussion of the changes which have occurred in the pronunciation of Lummi see Thompsons and Efrat, ""Some Phonological Developments in Straits Salish"", IJAL 40.3 (1974), pp. 182-196. 2this particle will occur throughout the text and we leave it untranslated. It is used frequently in narratives and indicates that the speaker does not have firsthand know- ledge of the matter being described. It corresponds to 'I heard tell that' and does not commit the speaker to the truth of the statement. An interesting property of Mr. Charles' speech is his tendency to raise unstressed final eo to # Thus Ce will frequently be heard as [Ce], ?ele will be [?2lx?}. --- Page 59 --- 52 1. $itp ce qé?ni?

(it was) not long that (they were) happy and then Sone of the most common structures in this narrative is the niZ k” s-u-verb sequence. nizZ has a wide range of meaning including ‘that one’, ‘that’s it', 'it' and so forth. The k”“ is introducing a factual clause in the sense of Kuipers (Aert Kuipers, The Squamish Language, 1969, p. 183). The s- has been identified as a nominalizer in other Salish dialects (Efrat, p. 61, Kuipers, p. 66). The -u- which also appears in this text as ?u? has been identified as a particle meaning ‘contemporaneous’ in a dialect closely related to Lummi. (Efrat, p. 38) Mr. Charles usually translates the underlined sequence (nil k* s-u-) as 'then'. We will follow his translation in this text. This niJ-structure can appear as a nil s-u- (sentence 8) or even shortened to as s-u- (sentences 5. and 19.). See footnote 8 for more details con- cerning nominalized verbs. 44 sentence negated with ?aw is usually followed by a subordinated form of the main Clause. Thus we find that the embedded predicate will take a s-prefix (the nominalizer?). One also finds x""- or even sx“- prefixed in this position. The pronunciation of this sequence is [aws his], but the kY subordinator and other particles can appear between the ?ow and the s, thus demonstrating the true nature of this con- struction (See e.g. sentence 21. or 104.). --- Page 60 --- AS 3. s-u-qéqelam-s . 4. qéqealam 21? yos ae quarreled-they. 4.

An '-s' can appear in subordinate clauses, however, as is demonstrated in the preceding sentence (s-u-qeqalem-s). Both t and n(ex“) are suffixes which transitivize a verb. The Thompsons use the term 'control' for the 't' to indicate that the subject in some way influences the action of the verb. The nex” form is weaker with respect to the involve- ment of the agent or subject. Thus when t is added to the verb len, the sequence len-t means 'to watch' or ‘look at’. The sequence t or n (n is an allomorphic variant of nox) plus n, corresponds to the English passive. Important dif- ferences exist between this construction in Salish and the English passive, however. (Thom Hess, ""Agent in a Cost Salish Language"", IJAL 39.2 (1973), pp. 89-94. ""Certain types of subordinate sentences with pronominal subjects cliticize the possessive form of the pronoun onto the (nominalized) verb. Thus ?on-s-ye? is ‘your going'. The third possessive affix follows its head noun as opposed to the prefixal nature of the first and second person possessives. 8the word for bone is s?otem. In the text Mr. Charles uses something like s¢?odem and translates this as bony or 'jittle-boned'. The Form s¢?o0¢am may be then a diminutive formed by reduplication (/Sé-s?oéem/). --- Page 61 --- 10. 10. 10. 10. 12. 12. 13. 13. 14. 14. 14. 14. 15. is. $4 co x*tozem. 9. xen-é-t sa sléni?-s ?ey? wore xX"". . 9, «~(he) told wife-his good I guess k” na-s-yé? tok“ 271? 2u? ?eLo-sx” ol . 10. if I went home and stay here-you just. 10.

When X“tolam got married to the young lady everyone was happy that he was united to the girl from Sqalexen. 3. But they were not happy very long and they started to quarrel. 4. They quarreled and were always quarreling. 5. Then X”toZem was told by his wife, ""I guess it would be good if you went home. 6. Go back. 7. Out there all you'll have to eat are those bony little animals."" 8. And X“tdZom answered. 9. He told his wife, ""It just might be good if I did go home, you can just stay here. 10. There are lots of steelhead, fat-legged steelhead here that you're going to eat. 11. You only eat steelhead."" 12. So X“toZam went home. 13. But he became lonesome. 14. Then he told his younger brother, ""I am going to go see""--and he named his wife, but I don't know what her name was. 15. And his younger brother said, ""I'll go along.'""' 16. He boarded his canoe and went to see his wife. 17. It was just half tide. 18. They didn't go ashore but went aground on a sandbar. 19. Then X“toZam said, ""Don't you come ashore. 20. If there is killing when the men come out, don't come ashore, go back."" 21. He hadn't reached his wife's house when she came out. 22. And then she sat down. 23. They sat and talked. 24. They talked a long time, and then came the men, the younger and older brothers of X“tolam's wife. 25. They murdered X“toJam. --- Page 77 --- 70 26. He was killed. 27. Then Sxaloqst went back. 28. He went home and told his parents, ""They killed X“tozem; they killed him."" 29. The thoughts of Sxaloqst were like this: 30. ""I will go back when I am finished with my training."" 31. Then Sxaloqst trained. 32. He bathed. 33. He bathed every day. 34. He went back to the lake, where he dived. 35. He dived everywhere, looking for his weapon, so that when he came back, he would have revenge. 36. So he dived at Blakely Island and then went to Point Lawrence. 37. He dived there at Point Lawrence. 38. He dived and went bathing in every lake. 39. Then he arrived at Deception Pass, and he dived there. 40. He came home again, and he climbed up on Mt. Constitution. 41. And there he dived. 42. Then he came ashore. 43. When he finished his diving, he came ashore and rested. 44. He rested a long time, and he began to feel sleepy. 45. Then he fell asleep. 46. He slept and dreamed about his weapon. 47. ""Your weapon is going to be like this. 48. Make it! 49. You will use it when fighting. 50. You will be a warrior. 51. The warrior of this place will be you."" $2. Then Sxalégst thought, ""It's good that I go to take revenge on those men."" 53. So he went back. 54. It was night when he arrived at Mom1i. 5S. He went inside the house, and he used his weapon. 56. He finished, and he reached the next house, and he did the same thing. 57. He finished, and he reached the next house. 58. He was doing --- Page 78 --- 71 this until the last one. 59. There, at the house at the end, an old man came out and said to him, ""Spare me! Don'to use your weapon: 60. If you don't, then this will be your land. Yours will be this land. Yours will be this river. 61. Everything will be yours.""' 62. Then Sxvloqst said, ""Good, it will be like this. 63. I will go home and tell my parents that you have given me your land and your river."" 64. Then Sxeléqst went home and told his parents that a : - : : Sdaléxen was his, and the river was his, the Sdoléxen river. 65. His parents believed him, and they told Sxaloqst, ""We guess it would be good if we went and looked at your land and your river."" 66. They came ashore, and oh, it truly was Sxaloqst's. 67. It truly was his land and the river. 68. They went back to Orcas Island. 69. They went to Lopez Island and broughtover the houses from Lopez Island. 70. They brought them to Gooseberry Point. 71. They set up their houses from Lopez Island at Gooseberry Point. 72. (It's like this about the houses: they were crowded where they were. 73. It was name X“lolomes. 74. The houses were like this: 75. If people came out, then they saw the people at the other house. 76. That's where the name Lummi comes from, from X“lolemas. 77. The houses weren't 'Lummi' but X“lolemes. 78. That's the name of the village, X“lolemas. 79. That's where the name ‘Lummi! comes from. 80. It's not Lummi but LeqamaS’ is the name, --- Page 79 --- Léegemas, from where these persons come, X“toZem and his younger brother. 81. JZéqama$ is where all the people come from, the Samish, Swinomish, Stillaguamish, Snohomish, Du- wamish, Suquamish. 82. That's the origin of the people. 83. Everybody is from the people who lived through the flood at Sqoléxen. 84. It was like this: the earth was covered with water and there were the raft-people. 85. The earth was covered with water and they made a raft which saved them from the big tide. 86. The ground was covered with water, but then the earth dried again, so they called this the raft place. 87. This is a very old story, it is not of today. 88. It is probably the ancestors of Sxeloqgst who named the lakes and the islands. 89. The names of these islands, the lakes, the mountains where Sxeloqst trained are not of today. 90. Truly Sxeloqst was a powerful warrior. 91. Everybody knows the name of Sxeloqst. 92. He was a warrior. 93. Everybody knows that Sxeloqst was a warrior, a powerful warrior., 94. When the earth dried, then the people scattered. 95. I have named those who went south, some went north. 96. If you see your friend he will say, ""I am from the people who lived through the flood, that's where I'm from. 97. ""Oh, sir, I, too, am from the people who lived through the flood,'' says your friend, when you see him. 98. When you go to the Duwamish or Suquamish people, they will say, ""I am from the people who lived through the --- Page 80 --- 73 flood."" 99. These people, the Léqomas are from here. 100. That's where they came from. 101. And the talk of the Leqeme¥ goes like this: ""Their smoke will stand up in your land. 102. Everybody will look} and it will be the ~Léqomas that they see, the high-class people. 103. Don't let your smoke fall. 104. Don't let your smoke fall.""",
