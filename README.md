# Lummi ↔ English Parallel Corpus Project

This project is designed to build a comprehensive **Lummi ↔ English parallel corpus**, supporting many-to-many relationships and enabling efficient searching, normalization, and merging of linguistic data from various sources, including PDFs and digital archives.

We have a couple different iterations of the corpus, and we wanted to keep all of them to show our progress in our work. The final corpus can be found in the processed_data folder, labeled as "analyzed_corpus.csv"
